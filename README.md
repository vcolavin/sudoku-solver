# Sudoku Solver Template

Hey! This sudoku solver doesn't work :(

I got the UI working pretty well, all that's left is functions that still need to be written. No big deal!

You can find them in `src/utils`.

## Instructions

- [ ] Fork this repo
- [ ] `npm i`, all that good stuff
- [ ] make sure it runs as expected with `npm start`
- [ ] poke around in the code to understand how it's working
- [ ] `npm test`. two tests will pass but that's only incidental
- [ ] fix the tests by writing those functions
- [ ] make a PR into this repo

## Extra credit
- [ ] Delete the `SudokuGrid` directory and build a new grid yourself.
- [ ] Make an interactive grid that the user can solve themself.
